            <h2>The story</h2>

            <p><span>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,</span><br><br>

            <q class="vil">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q><br><br>

            The farmer said,<br><br>

            <em><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></em><br><br>

            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<br><br>

            <q class="vil">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q><br><br>

            The farmer again said,<br><br>

            <em><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></em><br><br>

            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,<br><br>

            <q class="vil">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q><br><br>

            and the farmer responded,<br><br> 

            <em><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></em><br><br> 

            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<br><br>

            <q class="vil">Isn’t that great!</q><br><br>

            Again, he said,<br><br>

            <em><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></em><br><br>

            <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...<br><br>
